# TO-DO LIST

- Learn Lua
- Learn JSON
- Learn what the hell yarn.lock is (other then being some sort of github+ stuff or something)
- Make the first local or over the net connection with the Turtle

# NOTES

- Use the src/index.ts as your server initializer/controller.
- Follow Ottomated's Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwKRbsDbxqc) => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwKRbsDbxqc (Minecraft, but I hacked into the OfflineTV server)
- Use [CC: Tweaked's Wiki](https://tweaked.cc) to understand more about CC Turtle coding and behavior.
- Compare to Ottomated's code from the [repository](https://github.com/ottomated/turtle-gambit) in Github.
- Just use JavaScript over TypeScript (to not go over the TS to JS transformation-automation-gizmo).
